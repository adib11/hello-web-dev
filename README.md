# hello-web-dev
Project for a web-development training course

1. About this project
This group project it's actually a homework for a Web-Development Course, we - Cristi, Adi and Ale - are tring to complete by the end of the course. It consists in creating a puzzle with numbers and in answering a short quiz.

2. Numeric puzzle
Simply by cliking numbers around the empty cell, you can move them inside the empty cell, one by one. The idea is to order them from 0 to 14 or from 14 to 0 insede the table, so it all looks organized.

3. Quiz
Here we have tried to create a simple quiz related to numbers, a quiz that can be checked by clicking a button.

P.S. In doing this group project we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
